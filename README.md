Flower Garden is my first individual project for Code Institute's AI Augmented Full Stack Software Development Bootcamp. Flower Garden is a simple static website created with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap that aims to provide general Safeguarding advice and support through counselling.

The live website can be visited here.

# Project Planning

## User Stories

User stories have been issued and further detailed under the project board, and can be summarised as follows:

- As a first-time visitor, I need easy navigation and a user-friendly design, including a responsive layout for my device, so I can find information quickly and efficiently without frustration.

- As a vulnerable person, I want to see sensitive language and soft, calming imagery that makes me feel safe.

- As an adult experiencing abuse, I want the website to provide discreet help, so that I can take steps toward safety without fear of retaliation or scrutiny.

- As a concerned friend, I want to understand the warning signs of radicalization and abuse, so that I can support my loved ones and know when and how to intervene.

- As an educator/business professional, I want materials on safeguarding that I can share with my students/workers, so that I can proactively prevent radicalization and abuse.

- As a fellow survivor of abuse, I want a way to anonymously contribute to how safeguarding helped me, so that I can help keep people safe without putting myself in the public eye.

- As an inexperienced user, I want to see the services offered by the website delivered plainly and made easy to find. I want all mentioned services to be visible and accessible from the homepage.

## UX Design

### Colours

For colour, I opted to go with soft, natural colours to emphasize both the theming of flowers and the gentle approach needed to handle vulnerable and fragile individuals. I wanted the website to exude a mature, sensible feeling while still approaching a difficult topic with a general aura of ease and comfort.
